**Provider Introduction Packet (v1)** 


# 🩺 **Welcome to ClearHealth**

### Simple. Transparent. Fast-Paying Health Coverage.

Hello!
You’re receiving this because a patient in your office carries **ClearHealth Basic**, a new kind of health plan designed to make care **simple for both patients and providers**.

We’re not a traditional insurance company.
We don’t use networks, prior authorizations, or complex claim forms.
We just pay fairly — and fast.



## 💡 How ClearHealth Works

ClearHealth is a **transparent, HSA-compatible health plan**.
Members pay directly for care until they meet their deductible, using their HSA or a linked card.
Once their deductible is met, ClearHealth reimburses you at **120% of Medicare’s rate** (or your published cash price, if lower).

**No networks. No pre-approvals. No mystery pricing.**



## ⚙️ How to Bill ClearHealth

You can use *any of three easy methods* — whichever fits your workflow.

### **Option 1: Quick Portal (Fastest)**

1. Go to **[clearhealth.life/providers](https://clearhealth.life/providers)**
2. Enter the patient’s Member ID and your CPT code(s).
3. See the **exact ClearHealth rate** (120% of Medicare).
4. Collect payment from the patient or submit the claim for payment.
5. Receive **ACH payment within 48 hours.**

No login is required for simple lookups.



### **Option 2: Send an Invoice**

If you already have a cash or self-pay process, simply:

* Bill the patient directly at your usual cash price, **or**
* Send the invoice to **[claims@clearhealth.life](mailto:claims@clearhealth.life)** (PDF or itemized bill).

We’ll verify the service, process payment, and send ACH within **two business days.**
