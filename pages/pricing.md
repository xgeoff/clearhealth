**Pricing, business model, and regulatory path** — focused on an HSA-compatible, transparent, low-overhead plan like *ClearHealth Basic*.

## 💵 1. Pricing: What You Could Realistically Offer It For

Let’s model out how much this would cost per member per month (PMPM) using realistic assumptions.

### Core assumptions:

* **Plan type:** HSA-compatible HDHP
* **Deductible:** $2,000 / $4,000 family
* **Reimbursement basis:** Reference-based pricing (≈ 120 % of Medicare)
* **Stop-loss attachment:** $50,000 per individual
* **Target market:** healthy to average-risk individuals (freelancers, small LLCs)

| Cost Component              | Range (PMPM) | Description                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expected medical claims** | $200 – $300  | Includes preventive + routine + moderate acute claims |
| **Stop-loss reinsurance**   | $80 – $120   | Depends on attachment level & demographics            |
| **Administrative + TPA**    | $25 – $40    | Claims, enrollment, regulatory filings                |
| **Tech/platform fees**      | $5 – $10     | App, HSA integrations, Cost Plus API                  |
| **Margin / Reserves**       | $15 – $30    | Operating margin + required reserves                  |

### 🔹 Estimated Total Premium

| Tier              | Self-Only            | Family                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Base estimate** | **$325 – $400 PMPM** | **$850 – $1,050 PMPM** |

That’s roughly **$3,900 – $4,800 per year for an individual**, competitive with ACA bronze HDHPs — *but with transparency, Cost Plus prescriptions, and freedom from networks.*

You could even tier it by risk:

| Plan Variant           | Deductible | Monthly Premium | Audience                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **ClearHealth Lite**   | $3,000     | $280 PMPM       | Young / healthy individuals   |
| **ClearHealth Core**   | $2,000     | $350 PMPM       | Standard option               |
| **ClearHealth Family** | $4,000     | $900 PMPM       | 2-adult + children households |



## 🏦 2. Business Model Options

You have **three viable models**, each with different regulatory weight and go-to-market velocity.

### **Option A — MGA / MGU Partner Model (Fastest)**

* Partner with a licensed carrier that already offers HDHPs.
* You design the *plan wrapper* (Cost Plus, transparent UX).
* Act as an **MGA (Managing General Agent)** or **MGU (Underwriter)**.
* Revenue: per-member admin fee (e.g., $25 PMPM) + rev-share with carrier.

✅ *Advantages:* minimal capital, fast launch, leverages carrier compliance.
❌ *Limitation:* less control over underwriting and claims logic.



### **Option B — Self-Funded Plan Administrator (ERISA Path)**

* Form an **ERISA self-funded health plan** (common for employers > 10 people).
* You provide the plan design + tech + TPA services.
* Purchase **stop-loss reinsurance** for catastrophic coverage.
* Revenue: admin fees ($30 – $50 PMPM) + consulting + surplus sharing.

✅ *Advantages:* legal in all 50 states under ERISA pre-emption; very flexible.
❌ *Limitation:* requires an employer sponsor (so use groups, associations, or captives).



### **Option C — Captive Cooperative (Member-Owned Pool)**

* Create a **health benefit captive** (like Pareto Health or Roundstone).
* Members (individuals or small LLCs) join the captive.
* You manage claims, tech, and reinsurance relationships.
* Surpluses return as member dividends.

✅ *Advantages:* strong alignment, profit sharing, “mutual” brand story.
❌ *Limitation:* more legal structuring & capitalization needed.



### **How Each Makes Money**

| Revenue Stream             | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin Fee**              | Fixed PMPM (e.g., $30) for claims, tech, and support |
| **Stop-Loss Commission**   | 5 – 10 % margin from reinsurer contracts             |
| **Investment Float**       | Interest on premium reserves                         |
| **Data Services**          | Anonymized cost-transparency analytics for employers |
| **Wellness Rebate Margin** | Share in surplus if claims < expected                |



## ⚖️ 3. Regulatory Path — What’s Required to Be Legal

### **Phase 1: Non-Insurance (Software + Admin Only)**

If you act purely as a **TPA / tech platform**, you’re not selling insurance.
You only handle:

* Claims adjudication
* HSA integration
* Cost Plus API connections
* Member portal

👉 **No state insurance license required.**
You contract with licensed insurers or self-funded ERISA plans.



### **Phase 2: Self-Funded ERISA Plans**

Once you manage self-funded employer groups:

* **ERISA** governs the plan.
* You file a **Form 5500** annually.
* You follow DOL & IRS rules — not state DOIs.
* Must have fiduciary coverage (ERISA bond).

This is the most common route for innovative health startups because it pre-empts 50-state regulation.



### **Phase 3: Full Insurance License (If You Want to Underwrite)**

Eventually, you could:

* Form a **Captive Insurance Company** (domiciled in VT, MT, or AZ).
* Obtain a **Limited Scope Accident & Health license**.
* Register with the **NAIC** and each target state.
* Maintain statutory capital (typically $2 – 5 M + actuarial filings).

This lets you sell directly to individuals under your own paper — the long-term “insurtech” path (think Oscar, Sidecar, Taro).
