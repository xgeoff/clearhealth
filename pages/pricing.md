**Pricing, business model, and regulatory path** — focused on an HSA-compatible, transparent, low-overhead plan like *ClearHealth Basic.*

## 💵 1. Pricing: What You Could Realistically Offer It For

These estimates are based on realistic assumptions for a transparent, member-funded health plan that uses reference-based pricing and stop-loss protection.

### Core assumptions

* **Plan type:** HSA-compatible high-deductible plan
* **Deductible:** $2,000 / $4,000 family
* **Reimbursement basis:** approximately 120% of Medicare (reference-based)
* **Stop-loss attachment:** $50,000 per individual
* **Target market:** healthy to average-risk individuals (freelancers, LLC owners, and families)

| Cost Component              | Range (PMPM) | Description                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Expected medical claims** | $200 – $300  | Preventive, routine, and moderate acute care |
| **Stop-loss reinsurance**   | $80 – $120   | Depends on attachment level and demographics |
| **Administrative + TPA**    | $25 – $40    | Claims, eligibility, and member support      |
| **Tech / platform fees**    | $5 – $10     | Portal, HSA integrations, Cost Plus API      |
| **Margin / reserves**       | $15 – $30    | Operating margin and risk reserves           |

### Estimated Total Monthly Contribution

| Tier              | Self-Only            | Family                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Base estimate** | **$325 – $400 PMPM** | **$850 – $1,050 PMPM** |

This equates to roughly **$3,900 – $4,800 per year for an individual**, competitive with ACA bronze HDHPs but with clear pricing, Cost Plus prescriptions, and no network restrictions.

| Variant                | Deductible | Monthly Contribution | Audience                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **ClearHealth Lite**   | $3,000     | $280 PMPM            | Younger, low-utilization individuals |
| **ClearHealth Core**   | $2,000     | $350 PMPM            | Standard member profile              |
| **ClearHealth Family** | $4,000     | $900 PMPM            | Two adults plus children             |

## 🏦 2. Business Model Options

ClearHealth can scale through three structural approaches, each with its own timeline and regulatory considerations.

### Option A — Partner Model (MGA / MGU Hybrid)

* Partner with a licensed carrier that already offers HSA-eligible HDHP coverage.
* ClearHealth provides the transparent pricing layer and member-facing platform.
* Operate as a Managing General Agent (MGA) or Managing General Underwriter (MGU).
* Revenue: per-member admin fee (around $25 PMPM) and shared margin with the carrier.

**Advantages:** fastest route to market, leverages carrier licensing and compliance.
**Limitations:** less control over underwriting, claims, and fund logic.

### Option B — Member-Funded Health Pool (Current Model)

* Members contribute monthly to the **ClearHealth Fund**, held in a segregated trust.
* ClearHealth Admin Services LLC acts as the licensed TPA and administrator.
* Stop-loss coverage protects the fund against high-cost claims.
* Any year-end surplus can be retained as reserves or rebated to members.

**Advantages:** full control and transparency; non-ERISA, individual coverage; portable and scalable.
**Limitations:** requires strong trust, compliance, and reinsurance partnerships.

### Option C — Captive or Mutual Conversion (Phase 2 or 3)

* After scaling to several thousand members, form a regulated captive insurer.
* The captive assumes stop-loss risk and manages reserves and investments.
* Operates similarly to a member-owned mutual association.

**Advantages:** long-term control over risk and pricing, strong alignment with members.
**Limitations:** requires state licensing and $250k–$500k in capitalization.

### How ClearHealth Generates Revenue

| Revenue Stream           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admin Fee**            | Fixed PMPM for claims, tech, and member support              |
| **Stop-Loss Commission** | 5–10% margin on reinsurance contracts                        |
| **Investment Float**     | Interest earned on fund reserves                             |
| **Data & Insights**      | Aggregated transparency analytics for partners               |
| **Surplus Retention**    | Shared or retained margin when claims fall below projections |

## ⚖️ 3. Regulatory Path

### Phase 1 — Operate as a TPA / Tech Platform

* Register ClearHealth Admin Services LLC as a Third-Party Administrator in Washington or Delaware.
* Contract with stop-loss carriers, banks, and HSA custodians.
* Manage claims, member eligibility, and payment flow.
* No insurance license required; ClearHealth operates as a tech-enabled administrator.

### Phase 2 — Member-Funded Health Pool

* Launch ClearHealth Basic for individuals and small LLCs.
* Maintain funds in trust for transparency and member protection.
* Use stop-loss coverage to guard against catastrophic losses.
* Remains outside ERISA and state group plan regulations.

### Phase 3 — Captive Formation (After Scale)

* Apply for a captive license in Vermont, Delaware, or Hawaii.
* The captive reinsures the ClearHealth Fund and manages surplus reserves.
* Optional step toward becoming a regulated mutual insurer.
