title = "ClearHealthRx Discount Program Setup"
---
Excellent name — **ClearHealthRx** fits perfectly with your ClearHealth concept: simple, transparent, patient-first.

Now to your question:
No, **discount programs like ClearHealthRx are not hard to set up**, especially if you start with the right type of partner. The heavy lift (network contracts, pharmacy integrations, and BIN/IIN registration) is handled by a **pharmacy benefit network provider**—you’re basically layering your brand, rules, and pricing model on top.



## ⚙️ How Discount Cards Actually Work

A “discount card” is really a **PBM-lite** setup:

* The “card” has a **BIN/IIN number**, a **processor ID**, and a **group ID**.
* When a pharmacist enters those numbers, the claim routes through a **switch** (like Change Healthcare, RelayHealth, or Emdeon) to your **network processor**.
* The processor checks pricing agreements for that NDC (drug code) and returns a price, which the pharmacy honors at the register.

So for ClearHealthRx, you need:

1. **A network partner** — an existing pharmacy network that allows white-labeling.
2. **Pricing table** — usually a “cost + markup + fee” structure.
3. **Card issuing and BIN registration** — handled by your processor partner.
4. **Portal or app** — to look up drugs and display prices to members.

## 📜 Regulatory & Business Notes

* Discount cards are **not considered insurance**, so regulation is light.

    * You’ll need to **register as a discount medical plan organization (DMPO)** in a handful of states (TX, FL, IL, LA, etc.).
* The **partner handles HIPAA** for claim data; you just receive anonymized reporting unless you take on the compliance burden yourself.
* Some partners pay you a **small per-fill rebate** (e.g., $1–$3) or let you pass all savings to members.


## 🧭 Strategic Fit with Cost Plus

* Cost Plus becomes your **preferred pharmacy**.
* ClearHealthRx becomes your **fallback cash network** for everything else.
* Both are HSA-compatible and transparent — no hidden rebates, no spread pricing.
