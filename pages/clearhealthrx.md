# 💊 ClearHealthRx — Transparent Savings for Every Prescription

ClearHealth is built around a simple idea: members should always know what care costs, pay only what’s necessary, and never be trapped in opaque pricing.
That same philosophy extends to prescriptions.

## 🌿 The ClearHealth Prescription Strategy

Our plan integrates directly with **Cost Plus Drugs**, a trusted mail-order pharmacy offering medications at *actual cost + 15% + $3 pharmacy fee + $5 shipping*.
Most members will find everything they need through Cost Plus — transparent, HSA-eligible, and free of traditional PBM markups.

But for medications **not yet available** through Cost Plus, we provide a seamless fallback: **ClearHealthRx.**


## 💳 Introducing ClearHealthRx

**ClearHealthRx** is our nationwide prescription discount card, built to fill the gaps in Cost Plus coverage.
It gives members access to discounted cash pricing at over 60,000 retail pharmacies while keeping the same transparency and member-first principles.

**How it works:**

1. Search your medication in the ClearHealth portal or app.
2. See both prices — Cost Plus vs ClearHealthRx — instantly.
3. Choose mail-order delivery or in-store pickup.
4. Pay the displayed price. No hidden fees, no surprise markups.


## ⚙️ The Strategy Behind It

ClearHealthRx partners with trusted, transparent pharmacy networks to ensure:

* **Low, predictable pricing** for non-Cost Plus drugs.
* **HSA eligibility** for all transactions.
* **Data feedback loops** that help us identify which medications to add to Cost Plus over time.
* **No hidden rebates** — what you see is what you pay.

Together, **Cost Plus + ClearHealthRx** provide complete prescription coverage under one unified experience.

## 🧭 Why It Matters

By combining the Cost Plus direct-price model with the ClearHealthRx discount network:

* You eliminate PBM games and rebate distortions.
* Members always see their real, lowest available cost.
* Providers and pharmacists work within a single, transparent system.

It’s simple, fair, and clear — just like every other part of ClearHealth.


**ClearHealthRx**
Transparent savings. Nationwide access.
*For medications Cost Plus doesn’t carry — we’ve got you covered.*

## ⚙️ How Discount Cards Actually Work

A “discount card” is really a **PBM-lite** setup:

* The “card” has a **BIN/IIN number**, a **processor ID**, and a **group ID**.
* When a pharmacist enters those numbers, the claim routes through a **switch** (like Change Healthcare, RelayHealth, or Emdeon) to your **network processor**.
* The processor checks pricing agreements for that NDC (drug code) and returns a price, which the pharmacy honors at the register.

So for ClearHealthRx, you need:

1. **A network partner** — an existing pharmacy network that allows white-labeling.
2. **Pricing table** — usually a “cost + markup + fee” structure.
3. **Card issuing and BIN registration** — handled by your processor partner.
4. **Portal or app** — to look up drugs and display prices to members.

## 📜 Regulatory & Business Notes

* Discount cards are **not considered insurance**, so regulation is light.

    * You’ll need to **register as a discount medical plan organization (DMPO)** in a handful of states (TX, FL, IL, LA, etc.).
* The **partner handles HIPAA** for claim data; you just receive anonymized reporting unless you take on the compliance burden yourself.
* Some partners pay you a **small per-fill rebate** (e.g., $1–$3) or let you pass all savings to members.


## 🧭 Strategic Fit with Cost Plus

* Cost Plus becomes your **preferred pharmacy**.
* ClearHealthRx becomes your **fallback cash network** for everything else.
* Both are HSA-compatible and transparent — no hidden rebates, no spread pricing.

* You can **cross-promote**: members using Cost Plus get a ClearHealthRx card for non-Cost Plus meds.
