Excellent — here’s how your **Phase 1 launch blueprint** for *ClearHealth Basic* would look: a clear entity setup, operational flow, and early-year financial model.



## 🏗️ 1. Entity & Structural Setup

| Layer             | Entity                                   | Purpose                         | Notes                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Holding Co.**   | **ClearHealth LLC**                      | Owns IP, brand, and platform    | Washington or Delaware LLC                               |
| **Plan Sponsor**  | **ClearHealth Cooperative Plan**         | Self-funded ERISA plan          | Technically the “employer plan” (association or captive) |
| **Administrator** | **ClearHealth Admin Services LLC**       | Licensed TPA / service provider | Handles claims, eligibility, and member support          |
| **Reinsurer**     | Symetra / QBE / HM Insurance             | Provides stop-loss              | You’ll buy a per-member stop-loss policy                 |
| **HSA Custodian** | Lively / HealthEquity / Fidelity         | Holds HSA funds                 | Members contribute directly                              |
| **Bank & Trust**  | Cross River / Piermont / Blue Ridge Bank | Manages claim float account     | Needed for fiduciary segregation                         |

💡 *You control ClearHealth LLC + Admin Services; the cooperative/captive is member-owned for regulatory protection.*



## ⚙️ 2. Operational Flow

```
Member → enrolls → pays monthly contribution
        ↓
Funds split into:
   - Claim Fund (≈ 80 %)
   - Admin & Stop-Loss Premium (≈ 20 %)
        ↓
Member uses telehealth / Cost Plus / direct-care
        ↓
If claim < $50 k → paid from Claim Fund
If claim ≥ $50 k → Stop-Loss reimburses ClearHealth Plan
        ↓
Year-end surplus → retained or rebated to members
```



## 💰 3. Financial Model (Year 1 Projection)

### **Assumptions**

* 1,000 members (average risk)
* $350 PMPM premium
* $325 average PMPM medical + admin cost
* 10 % surplus target

| Category                              | PMPM                        | Annual Total |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Premium Revenue**                   | $350 × 1,000 × 12 = $4.2 M  | $4,200,000   |
| **Expected Claims (80 %)**            | $280 × 1,000 × 12 = $3.36 M | $3,360,000   |
| **Stop-Loss Premium (8 %)**           | $28 × 1,000 × 12 = $336 k   | $336,000     |
| **Admin + Tech (8 %)**                | $28 × 1,000 × 12 = $336 k   | $336,000     |
| **Operating Margin / Reserves (4 %)** | ≈ $168 k                    | $168,000     |

➡ **Net Year-1 Surplus:** ≈ $168 k (4 %) — can fund regulatory filings, marketing, or early rebates.
➡ If claims run < expected, surplus rises to 10 – 12 %.



## 🧾 4. Capital & Regulatory Requirements

| Category                      | Requirement                       | Est. Cost     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Initial Capital**           | Reserve for 2 months claims + ops | $700 k – $1 M |
| **ERISA Bond**                | $500 k coverage                   | $2 – 3 k/year |
| **Stop-Loss Premium Deposit** | 1 month upfront                   | $25 – 50 k    |
| **Legal & Filing**            | Plan Docs, 5500, contracts        | $50 – 100 k   |
| **Tech MVP Build**            | Member portal + claims API        | $100 – 150 k  |

➡ **Target capital to launch:** ≈ **$1.0 – 1.3 M** (includes float + operations).



## ⚖️ 5. Regulatory Path

### **Step 1 – Operate as a TPA (Non-insurance)**

* File as a **Third-Party Administrator** in WA or DE.
* Contract with stop-loss carrier + HSA custodian.
* No insurance license needed.

### **Step 2 – Self-Funded ERISA Plan**

* Sponsor an association plan (freelancers, LLC owners, etc.).
* Register plan with DOL (Form 5500).
* Purchase stop-loss → reinsurance covers catastrophic claims.
* Maintain fiduciary bond + ERISA SPD.

### **Step 3 – Captive or Health Co-op**

* Form a Vermont or Delaware captive after 1–2 years.
* Minimum capital: ≈ $250–500 k.
* Gains full control of stop-loss and investment float.



## 🌱 6. Growth Model

| Phase            | Members | Revenue       | Notes                              |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Pilot (6 mo)** | 100–250 | $100 k–$300 k | Prove claims < 85 % loss ratio     |
| **Year 1**       | 1,000   | $4.2 M        | Add reinsurance partner            |
| **Year 2**       | 3,000   | $12 M         | Add DPC & Wellness add-ons         |
| **Year 3+**      | 10 k+   | $40 M+        | Captive conversion + state filings |

## 🚀 8. Next Steps for You

1. **Entity formation** – create *ClearHealth LLC* and *Admin Services LLC*.
2. **Engage an actuarial consultant** – project expected claims & stop-loss quotes.
3. **Line up TPA and reinsurer** – secure contracts.
4. **Build the MVP stack** – member portal, claims ledger, Cost Plus API.
5. **Launch pilot group** (100–250 members).
6. **File ERISA documents + bond** (with DOL).
7. **Collect 3–6 months claims data** → use for captive application.



Would you like me to build a **financial projection spreadsheet template** (with adjustable inputs for members, premiums, and stop-loss pricing) so you can model multiple scenarios — pilot, growth, and captive phases?
