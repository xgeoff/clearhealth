## 🩺 1. Why Concierge / DPC Works So Well with ClearHealth

| Traditional Insurance    | ClearHealth + Concierge               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Complex networks         | Any provider you choose               |
| Fee-for-service chaos    | Flat subscription + transparent rates |
| Delays & denials         | Direct, instant payment               |
| Low trust, high overhead | High trust, low friction              |

Concierge and DPC physicians typically charge a **monthly or annual membership fee** (e.g., $60–$150/month) that covers most routine visits, labs, and basic care.
This complements your model’s **HSA-compatible HDHP** — the concierge fee replaces what would normally be spent on small, fragmented claims.


## ⚙️ 2. How to Integrate Concierge Care Operationally

### Option A — “Member pays concierge directly” (simplest)

* Member pays the concierge doctor their monthly/annual fee out of pocket.
* All other medical expenses (specialists, labs, imaging, hospital, etc.) flow through ClearHealth.
* The concierge doctor can still refer and coordinate care through your transparent pricing system.

✅ *Easiest to launch, no regulatory issues.*
❌ Concierge fees aren’t always HSA-eligible (see below).


### Option B — “ClearHealth DPC Add-On Plan”

* ClearHealth offers an optional **Direct Care Add-On** (say, $100/month).
* That money is automatically paid to a participating DPC or concierge partner.
* The plan’s deductible and HSA rules apply only to non-primary care expenses.

✅ Makes you the first plan to **bundle primary + catastrophic coverage** cleanly.
❌ Requires clear IRS language to preserve HSA eligibility (see next section).


## ⚖️ 3. HSA Compatibility Considerations

Under current IRS rules, **HSA funds can’t be used to pay a retainer or membership fee** for concierge care *if it covers ongoing access to care before the deductible.*
However:

* If the concierge fee only covers **non-medical services** (e.g., priority scheduling, communication), it may qualify.
* You can structure it as a **separate non-insurance subscription**, while ClearHealth remains the HDHP.

**Bottom line:**
Keep the concierge membership separate from the HSA-linked insurance product, and your plan remains fully HSA-compatible.


## 🤝 4. Why Concierge Providers Would Join

Because you’d make their business *better*, not harder:

* No insurance contracts or claims.
* Fast, guaranteed electronic payments for labs, imaging, or referrals.
* Their patients get affordable catastrophic coverage that preserves the concierge relationship.
* Concierge clinics can even white-label your plan for their patients.

You could pitch it as:

> “We’re the insurance that makes concierge medicine possible for everyone.”


## 💡 5. Strategic Upside

**For members:** predictable costs, premium experience, direct access to their doctor.
**For providers:** steady cash flow, less admin, higher patient satisfaction.
**For ClearHealth:** differentiation from every other insurer — you *align* with the doctor–patient relationship instead of fighting it.
