title = "Clean Prescription Strategy: Cost Plus + Discount Program"
---
A **prescription drug strategy** that leverages **Cost Plus Drugs** as the primary fulfillment channel, supplemented by a **discount card program** for uncovered medications.
## 💊 Prescription Strategy Overview

### 🧩 1. Default Flow (Cost Plus)

* **Preferred channel**: All covered members use Cost Plus for prescriptions.
* **Integration**: Your insurance plan (or HSA-compatible wrapper) has a direct link to Cost Plus’s pricing and ordering system.
* **Benefit**: Cost Plus pricing is transparent, fixed markup, and eliminates PBM middlemen.



### 💊 2. Backup Channel (Discount Card)

When a medication isn’t available through Cost Plus:

**Option A: Partner with an existing network**

* Work with a **transparent PBM alternative** like **SingleCare**, **GoodRx**, or **ScriptCo** as a fallback.
* You can **white-label** these as a “ReachRx” or “LucernaRx” card.
* When a member goes to a pharmacy, they present this card.
* You negotiate to **collect de-identified usage data** to track costs and identify drugs to push onto the Cost Plus formulary later.

**Option B: Build your own discount network**

* Use **NABP-accredited** mail-order or retail partners who agree to a **cash-price schedule** (like the Medicare or NADAC benchmark rate + small fee).
* You aggregate these into your own internal “discount card” system.
* Members can see both Cost Plus and your fallback prices in one app or portal.

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Affiliate Discount Card**   | Partner with GoodRx, SingleCare, etc. and brand it                                       | Low         | Quick, compliant, immediate coverage gap fix    |
| **Custom Cash Price Network** | Negotiate directly with independent pharmacies                                           | Medium      | Higher control, better margins, more work       |
| **PBM-Lite Arrangement**      | Use a transparent PBM like **CapitalRx** or **Navitus** for limited formulary management | Medium–High | Keeps compliance and adjudication simple        |
| **Hybrid Portal**             | Members see both Cost Plus and fallback prices, choose best                              | Medium      | Gives consumer control, reinforces transparency |



### 💡 Strategic Advantage

By combining Cost Plus + a transparent fallback:

* You **sidestep PBM rebate games** entirely.
* You **maintain transparency** — members always see what each option costs.
* You can **learn** from real-world purchasing data which drugs matter most, and potentially **negotiate Cost Plus to add them**.
