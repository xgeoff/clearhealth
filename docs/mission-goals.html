<p>Here’s a clear, plain-language version you can use in a pitch deck, website, or one-page summary — three concise descriptions that communicate <strong>what ClearHealth is</strong>, <strong>why it exists</strong>, and <strong>what it’s trying to accomplish.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>1. Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To make health insurance simple, transparent, and fair — for both patients and providers.
We believe people should know exactly what care costs, pay only what’s necessary, and never have to fight their insurance company to get reimbursed.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Our Model</strong></h3>
<p>ClearHealth combines an HSA-compatible high-deductible plan with real-time pricing and direct payment.
Members see the true cost of care up front, pay using their HSA or card, and get reimbursed instantly when their deductible is met.
Providers are paid in days, not months — at a fair, published rate (typically 120 % of Medicare).</p>
<h3><strong>3. Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>To build a sustainable, technology-driven alternative to traditional insurance — one that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuts administrative overhead by 70 %</li>
<li>Restores trust between doctors and patients</li>
<li>Gives people control of their own health spending</li>
<li>Rewards transparency and preventive care</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: <strong>ClearHealth aims to be the health plan that doesn’t suck — simple, honest coverage for modern healthcare.</strong></p>
<p>Would you like a short <strong>investor-ready slide version</strong> (with bullet-point metrics, TAM/SAM/SOM framing, and a one-sentence elevator pitch)?</p>
