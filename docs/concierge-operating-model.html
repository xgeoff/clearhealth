<p>Here’s how you could <strong>legally and operationally structure</strong> ClearHealth’s partnership with concierge or direct primary care (DPC) physicians — while preserving <strong>HSA compatibility</strong>, simplifying operations, and making it investor-credible.</p>
<p>We’ll go step by step:
1️⃣ legal/regulatory model,
2️⃣ contract relationships,
3️⃣ money flow,
4️⃣ how to position it in marketing and compliance materials.</p>
<h2>⚖️ 1. Legal &amp; Regulatory Model</h2>
<p>You’ll be combining <strong>two entities</strong> under one “member experience,” but they must remain legally separate:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Entity</th><th>Legal Category</th><th>Role</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>ClearHealth Basic HDHP</strong></td><td>High Deductible Health Plan (insurance / self-funded plan)</td><td>Covers major medical, hospitalization, specialty care, prescriptions (Cost Plus).</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Concierge / DPC Practice</strong></td><td>Medical service provider (non-insurance)</td><td>Provides primary care access for a flat monthly/annual fee.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>➡ The <strong>key to preserving HSA eligibility</strong> is that ClearHealth never directly pays for or bundles the concierge subscription as part of the insurance policy.
The member pays that separately (or via payroll deduction if an employer offers both).</p>
<p>The IRS considers a plan “non-HSA eligible” if it provides <em>first-dollar medical coverage</em> before the deductible is met — so concierge fees must be kept outside the HDHP.</p>
<h2>🧾 2. Contractual Relationships</h2>
<p>You’ll need three simple, separate agreements:</p>
<h3><strong>A. Member ↔ ClearHealth (Insurance Agreement)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Standard HDHP terms (IRS-compliant, ERISA or state-regulated).</li>
<li>Member agrees to pay monthly premium.</li>
<li>Plan covers catastrophic and post-deductible medical expenses.</li>
<li>Defines reference pricing (120% of Medicare), Cost Plus drug pricing, deductible, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>B. Member ↔ Concierge Practice (Service Agreement)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A direct primary care contract (between patient and physician).</li>
<li>Describes the scope of included services (routine visits, messaging, labs).</li>
<li>Explicitly states it is <strong>not insurance</strong> and does <strong>not cover hospitalization, specialists, or emergencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Payment handled directly (credit card, ACH, or payroll deduction).</li>
<li>Optional clause: “This membership does not impact HSA eligibility for the ClearHealth HDHP.”</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>C. ClearHealth ↔ Concierge Practice (Marketing &amp; Data-Sharing Agreement)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defines a <strong>non-financial partnership</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared marketing (the practice can promote ClearHealth as a recommended catastrophic plan).</li>
<li>Optional data exchange (care coordination, referrals).</li>
<li>No shared revenue or bundled pricing (to preserve HSA status).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional referral incentive (fixed marketing fee, not percentage-based premium sharing).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>💰 3. Money Flow</h2>
<p>Here’s the simple, compliant flow of funds:</p>
<pre><code>        Member
          │
   ┌──────┴────────┐
   │               │
ClearHealth      Concierge Practice
  (Premium)        (Subscription Fee)
   │               │
  Claim Fund → pays post-deductible care
                  │
        Provides primary care, labs, referrals
</code></pre>
<p>If the concierge clinic performs labs or procedures <strong>not included</strong> in their membership (e.g., imaging, biopsy), the member can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay cash (counts toward deductible), or</li>
<li>Submit the invoice to ClearHealth once deductible is met.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🧩 4. Example Contract Language (Simplified)</h2>
<h3><strong>Concierge Service Agreement (Excerpt)</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This Agreement is between Dr. Jane Smith, MD (“Provider”) and John Doe (“Patient”).
Provider agrees to make available routine and preventive medical services described herein for an annual fee of $1,200.
This Agreement is <strong>not health insurance</strong>, does not cover hospital services, emergency care, or care provided by other physicians or facilities, and does not replace insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Patient acknowledges that their ClearHealth HDHP remains their primary insurance plan and that this Agreement does not affect their eligibility to contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>ClearHealth – Provider Affiliation Agreement (Excerpt)</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Provider agrees to make ClearHealth members aware of the ClearHealth HDHP as an optional catastrophic coverage plan.
Provider may disclose non-identifiable utilization data to ClearHealth for the purposes of coordination, analysis, and quality reporting.
Provider shall not receive any portion of insurance premiums or act as an agent of the Plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>🧠 5. Marketing and Positioning</h2>
<h3><strong>For Members</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Keep your personal doctor. Get real insurance for the big stuff.”
ClearHealth covers hospitals, specialists, and emergencies.
Your DPC or concierge doctor covers everything else.
Together, you get full-spectrum care with total price transparency.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>For Doctors</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’re already doing direct primary care. We give your patients affordable catastrophic protection — without making you deal with insurance.”</p>
<ul>
<li>No network contracts.</li>
<li>No billing headaches.</li>
<li>Your patients stay loyal because they finally have coverage for major medical events.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>For Investors</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“ClearHealth bridges the gap between direct primary care and traditional insurance.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a hybrid model that aligns incentives across the system.</li>
<li>Reduces claim volume by 60–80%.</li>
<li>Partners with existing DPC networks for rapid distribution.</li>
<li>Preserves HSA compatibility (IRS HDHP compliant).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>📊 6. Growth and Partnerships</h2>
<p>You could start with <strong>pilot partnerships</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>3–5 concierge clinics or DPC practices in Washington and Oregon.</li>
<li>Enroll their panels into ClearHealth as a preferred catastrophic coverage.</li>
<li>Offer them co-branded marketing material: <em>“ClearHealth + Dr. Smith Concierge Care.”</em></li>
<li>Use this as your <strong>distribution channel</strong> — physicians become your sales force.</li>
</ul>
<p>By Year 2, integrate with existing DPC networks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hint Health</li>
<li>Nextera Healthcare</li>
<li>Atlas MD</li>
<li>Elation Health (EHR with DPC support)</li>
</ul>
<p>These platforms already handle billing, scheduling, and contracts — meaning integration is low-cost.</p>

I can structure them as simple Markdown or DOCX templates, suitable for your startup’s legal folder.</p>
