<p>Yes — in fact, <strong>ClearHealth and concierge medicine fit together almost perfectly</strong>, as long as the plan is structured thoughtfully. Concierge or “direct primary care” (DPC) physicians already align with your model’s values: transparency, simplicity, and no insurance middlemen.</p>
<p>Here’s how it would work, what to watch out for legally, and how you could make it a key differentiator.</p>
<h2>🩺 1. Why Concierge / DPC Works So Well with ClearHealth</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Traditional Insurance</th><th>ClearHealth + Concierge</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Complex networks</td><td>Any provider you choose</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fee-for-service chaos</td><td>Flat subscription + transparent rates</td></tr>
<tr><td>Delays &amp; denials</td><td>Direct, instant payment</td></tr>
<tr><td>Low trust, high overhead</td><td>High trust, low friction</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Concierge and DPC physicians typically charge a <strong>monthly or annual membership fee</strong> (e.g., $60–$150/month) that covers most routine visits, labs, and basic care.
This complements your model’s <strong>HSA-compatible HDHP</strong> — the concierge fee replaces what would normally be spent on small, fragmented claims.</p>
<h2>⚙️ 2. How to Integrate Concierge Care Operationally</h2>
<h3>Option A — “Member pays concierge directly” (simplest)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Member pays the concierge doctor their monthly/annual fee out of pocket.</li>
<li>All other medical expenses (specialists, labs, imaging, hospital, etc.) flow through ClearHealth.</li>
<li>The concierge doctor can still refer and coordinate care through your transparent pricing system.</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <em>Easiest to launch, no regulatory issues.</em>
❌ Concierge fees aren’t always HSA-eligible (see below).</p>
<h3>Option B — “ClearHealth DPC Add-On Plan”</h3>
<ul>
<li>ClearHealth offers an optional <strong>Direct Care Add-On</strong> (say, $100/month).</li>
<li>That money is automatically paid to a participating DPC or concierge partner.</li>
<li>The plan’s deductible and HSA rules apply only to non-primary care expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Makes you the first plan to <strong>bundle primary + catastrophic coverage</strong> cleanly.
❌ Requires clear IRS language to preserve HSA eligibility (see next section).</p>
<h2>⚖️ 3. HSA Compatibility Considerations</h2>
<p>Under current IRS rules, <strong>HSA funds can’t be used to pay a retainer or membership fee</strong> for concierge care <em>if it covers ongoing access to care before the deductible.</em>
However:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the concierge fee only covers <strong>non-medical services</strong> (e.g., priority scheduling, communication), it may qualify.</li>
<li>You can structure it as a <strong>separate non-insurance subscription</strong>, while ClearHealth remains the HDHP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong>
Keep the concierge membership separate from the HSA-linked insurance product, and your plan remains fully HSA-compatible.</p>
<h2>🤝 4. Why Concierge Providers Would Join</h2>
<p>Because you’d make their business <em>better</em>, not harder:</p>
<ul>
<li>No insurance contracts or claims.</li>
<li>Fast, guaranteed electronic payments for labs, imaging, or referrals.</li>
<li>Their patients get affordable catastrophic coverage that preserves the concierge relationship.</li>
<li>Concierge clinics can even white-label your plan for their patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could pitch it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re the insurance that makes concierge medicine possible for everyone.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>💡 5. Strategic Upside</h2>
<p><strong>For members:</strong> predictable costs, premium experience, direct access to their doctor.
<strong>For providers:</strong> steady cash flow, less admin, higher patient satisfaction.
<strong>For ClearHealth:</strong> differentiation from every other insurer — you <em>align</em> with the doctor–patient relationship instead of fighting it.</p>
<h2>🚀 Example Product Bundle</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Plan Tier</th><th>Description</th><th>Monthly Total</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>ClearHealth Basic</strong></td><td>HDHP + transparent pricing</td><td>$350</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ClearHealth + DPC</strong></td><td>HDHP + direct primary care partner</td><td>$450</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ClearHealth Concierge</strong></td><td>HDHP + premium concierge network</td><td>$600–700</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You could easily market this as <strong>“modern coverage for people who actually value their doctor.”</strong></p>
<p>Would you like me to show how this could be <strong>structured contractually and marketed</strong> — e.g., what the agreements look like between ClearHealth, a concierge practice, and the member (and how to keep it HSA-compliant)?</p>
